        <p><img src="cameroon-1.jpeg" width="20%" height="25%" align="left">Cameroon Football Federation President Samuel Eto’o who was also a former striker has apologised for a “violent altercation” after attacking a man outside the World Cup stadium following Brazil’s 4-1 victory over South Korea earlier this week.

            On Monday, fans were taking selfies with Eto’o outside Stadium 974 in Doha when he was approached by a man who was filming him and made some comments that angered Eto’o, as seen in videos that went viral on social media.
